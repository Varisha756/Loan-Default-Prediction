## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (PyCharm)
- SQL (MySQL + SQLAlchemy)
- Power BI
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Loan data stored in SQL database
2. Data loaded into Python using SQLAlchemy
3. Feature engineering (EMI-to-Income Ratio)
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Power BI dashboard for insights

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
